# Life_Expectancy_Analysis

## Project Objective

The objective of this project was to obtain a data set that contained information on the life expectancy of various populations and to determine what the strongest correlations are.

## Key Questions

- Which variables have the strongest correlation, positive or negative, with life expectancy?
- Is there a singular variable that can be proven using linear regression?
- Can these variables be proven using cluster analysis?

## Data and Tools

Data set was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated?resource=download)

Python used for all analysis
